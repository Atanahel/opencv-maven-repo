# opencv-maven-repo
Maven repository for OpenCV library

This repository is only for personal use to host compiled version of OpenCV with java support for different OSes.

In case I have to change the files (for any reason) and maven does not want to update your project, force it with `mvn dependency:purge-local-repository` in your project directory
